      selectively receive the information that seems important to the individual
      and skip the rest in order to quickly obtain the target information.

      Q.What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was frustrating when hovering caused changes that made it seem like
      something could be clicked, but clicking didnâ€™t actually work.

    <h2>
      Q.What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I scrolled down and the screen shifted sideways instead of moving
      down, I found it intriguing and impressive, especially after studying
      coding. I am satisfied with this interaction.
