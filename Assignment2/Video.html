          Lyrics<br />
          Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br />
          You know that I caught it<br />
          Bad, bad boy<br />
          Shiny toy with a price<br />   
          You know that I bought it<br />
          Killing me slow, out the window<br />
          I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below<br />
          Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br />
          What doesn't kill me makes me want you more<br />
          And it's new, the shape of your body<br />
          It's blue, the feeling I've got<br />
          And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br />
          It's a cruel summer<br />
          It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br />
          No rules in breakable heaven<br />
          But ooh, whoa oh<br />
          It's a cruel summer<br />
          With you<br />
          Hang your head low<br />
          In the glow of the vending machine<br />
          I'm not dying<br />
          You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br />
          We're not trying<br />
          So cut the headlights, summer's a knife<br />
          I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<br />
          Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br />
          And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know<br />
          Oh, it's new, the shape of your body<br />
          It's blue, the feeling I've got<br />
          And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br />
          It's a cruel summer<br />
          It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br />
          No rules in breakable heaven<br />
          But ooh, whoa, oh<br />
          It's a cruel summer<br />
          With you<br />
          I'm drunk in the back of the car<br />
          And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br />
          Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true<br />
          I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br />
          And I snuck in through the garden gate<br />
          Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)<br />
          And I screamed for whatever it's worth<br />
          "I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?<br />
          He looks up grinning like a devil<br />
          It's new, the shape of your body<br />
          It's blue, the feeling I've got<br />
          And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br />
